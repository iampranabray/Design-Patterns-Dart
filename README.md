Introduction
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Design Patterns are reusable solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They help to make software more modular, flexible, and maintainable by providing a way to create a blueprint for solving a specific problem that can be reused in different situations.

Dart is a modern object-oriented programming language that is used for building web, mobile, and server-side applications. This repository provides examples of OOPs Design Patterns implemented in Dart language.

## Patterns Covered
This repository covers the following OOPs Design Patterns:

* Singleton
* Factory Method
* Abstract Factory
* Builder
* Prototype
* Adapter
* Bridge
* Composite
* Decorator
* Facade
* Flyweight
* Proxy
* Chain of Responsibility
* Command
* Interpreter
* Iterator
* Mediator
* Memento
* Observer
* State
* Strategy
* Template Method
* Visitor
Each pattern has its own directory with an implementation in Dart, and a README file explaining the pattern and how it was implemented.

## Requirements
To run the examples, you need to have the following installed on your machine:

Dart SDK
## Getting Started
To get started, you can clone this repository using Git:
```git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/oops-design-patterns-dart.git```
## Usage
Each pattern has its own directory with an implementation in Dart, and a README file explaining the pattern and how it was implemented. To run the examples, navigate to the directory of the pattern you are interested in and run the following command:
`dart main.dart`
